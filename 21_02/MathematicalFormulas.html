    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p>
        <strong>a<span>x</span> + b = 0</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        where <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are real numbers and
        <strong>x</strong> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the
        standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations
        will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be
        an <strong>x</strong> so don't get too locked into always seeing an
        <strong>x</strong> there.
    </p>
    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

    <p>
        The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>a<span>x</span><sup>2</sup> + b<span>x</span> + c = 0</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        where <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong> are known values
        and <strong>x</strong> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).
        Also, <strong>a</strong> can't be 0.
    </p>

    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>π</strong> (Pi) times the radius (<strong>r</strong>) squared:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A = π x r<sup>2</sup></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        or, when you know the diameter (<strong>D</strong>):
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A = (π / 4) x D<sup>2</sup></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        or, when you know the circumference (<strong>C</strong>):
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 x π</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Intersection</h3>

    <p>
        The intersection of two sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>,
        denoted by <strong>A B</strong>, is the set of all objects that
        are members of both the sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>.
        In symbols,
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>A B = { x : x A and x B }</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        That is, <strong>x</strong> is an element of the intersection
        <strong>A B</strong> if and only if <strong>x</strong> is both an
        element of <strong>A</strong> and an element of <strong>B</strong>.
    </p>
