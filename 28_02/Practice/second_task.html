            <b>Computer programming</b> is the process of designing and building an executable computer program
            for accomplishing a specific computing task. <b>Programming</b> involves tasks such as analysis,
            generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
            implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).
            The source code of a program is written in one or more languages.

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were
            programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could
            produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes
            punched in them.
        </p>

        <p>However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
            algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
            Analytical Engine. Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
        </p>

        <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control
            panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by
            the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in
            a similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program
            computers introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer
            memory.
        </p>

        <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine,
            often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction
            in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for
            specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a
            machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.
            Kathleen Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various computers at Birkbeck
            College.

        <h2 id="modern">Modern programming</h2>
        <p>Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The
            following properties are among the most important:
        </p>

        <h3 id="quality">Quality requirements</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct.</li>
            <li>Robustness: how well a program anticipates errors.</li>
            <li>Usability: the ergonomics of a program.</li>
            <li>Portability: the range of hardware and operating systems.</li>
            <li>Maintainability: the ease of modifying a program.</li>
            <li>Efficiency: system resources a program consumes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="readability">Readability of source code</h3>
        <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose,
            control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability,
            usability and most importantly maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand
            and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to
            bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[25] found that a few simple readability transformations
            made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.
        </p>

        <h3 id="complexity">Algorithmic complexity</h3>
        <p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with
            discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose,
            algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as
            execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with
            a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose
            algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.</p>

        <h3 id="chess">Chess algorithms as an example</h3>
        <p>"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" algorithm that is part
            of the history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer) is part of the
            computer science curriculum at Stanford University.[27]</p>

        <h2 id="languages">Programming languages</h2>
        <p>Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The
            choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task,
            availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best
            suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers
            who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency
            with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from
            "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to
            execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is
            usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.
        </p>

        <h2 id="programmers">Programmers</h2>
        <p>Computer programmers are those who write computer software. Their jobs usually involve:</p>
